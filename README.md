### Recipe or any translatable resource
This is examples requests of the recipe resource but any translatable resource will look roughly the same.
For available endpoints and body schemas visit `/api`.
#### List
Lists recipies in the users most preferred language.
* If query parameter `language` is defined it will override the header if present.
* If query parameter `language` is set to the string value `original` the list will recipies with their original language.
  This means that the list may include recipies with mixed languages
* Possible paging is found in the `Link` header. `rel="prev"` and `rel="next"` are only provided if they are relevant.
